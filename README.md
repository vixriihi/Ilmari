## Settings up development environment
Clone this repository with command `git clone https://github.com/viltsu/Ilmari`.
Go to directory and run `npm install`(only for the first time) and then `npm run start` for a dev server (naturally you need to have npm and node installed for these to work). 

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
